# Horse management Api

The Horse Management System API is a backend service designed to efficiently manage horse records and their associated owners with role-based access control (RBAC). The system ensures that users can only access and modify data according to their assigned permissions. It provides secure endpoints to create, update, delete, and retrieve horse information while maintaining data integrity and user authorization.
